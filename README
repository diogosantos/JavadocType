JavadocType is a tool to fix the Javadoc Type violation for sonar covered projects.

TODO list:
- ask for svn username and password, instead of having it hardcoded
- make it integrated to maven, so you can just inform your parent project and then the tool take care of every module
- It would be great to have a log of all modifications the tool did to the project
- take care of the end of file styles of the files
